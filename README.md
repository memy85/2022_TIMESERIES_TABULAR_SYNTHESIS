# 2022_TIMESERIES_TABULAR_SYNTHESIS
- Author : Won Seok Jang
- Purpose : Develop a privacy preserving data synthesis algorithms for time series tabular format data. 

---
## Motivation
- There are no promising algorithms for publishing or data sharing algorithms in the field. 
- However, there is a high need and recognition of publishing such important and sensitive data, which is necessary and beneficial to the development of high precision AI models.

## Project Aims
- Develop a data synthesis algorithms that synthesizes timeseries tabular format data. 
- Accelerate data publishing and data sharing in the medical field. 

## Simulation Data
1. [eICU Collaborative Research data](https://eicu-crd.mit.edu/)


## Code Description
